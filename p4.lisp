;;; You could try dividing the list into two lists, one consisting of association pairs
;;; known to be reachable from FROM and ones not know to be reachable, then
;;; using the property of transitivity, move pairs from the second list to the first

;;;;;; PLANNING CODE TEMPLATES
;;;;;;
;;;;;; The following are the functions I used to implement my planner.
;;;;;; You have been given all interfaces I used, but no implementation.
;;;;;; This is how I went about doing it -- if you want to you can of course
;;;;;; do the code differently, but indicate that you are doing so.
;;;;;;
;;;;;; The recursion looks like this:
;;;;;; SELECT-SUBGOAL calls CHOOSE-OPERATOR, which calls HOOK-UP-OPERATOR,
;;;;;; which calls RESOLVE-THREATS, which in turn calls SELECT-SUBGOAL.
;;;;;; All of these functions return a either plan
;;;;;; (the solution) or NIL (failure to find a solution).
;;;;;; 
;;;;;; In SELECT-SUBGOAL I test to see if the maximum depth is exceeded
;;;;;; and fail immediately if it is.  That's the only place I check for
;;;;;; depth.  You are free to test other places if you want.  Then I
;;;;;; I increment the current depth before passing it to CHOOSE-OPERATOR.
;;;;;;
;;;;;; Some hints: I also used PUSH and SETF and DOLIST a lot,
;;;;;; as well as a healthy dose of MAPCAR, MAPC, and MAPL.  Also you might
;;;;;; want to read up on CONSes of the form (a . b) which I use a lot,
;;;;;; and also ASSOCIATION LISTS which are very convenient in certain spots

;;;;;; THREE-BLOCK-WORLD
;;;;;; You have three blocks on the table, A, B, and C.
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;
;;; Why so many operators?  Because we don't have a variable facility.
;;; We can't say MOVE(x,y,z) -- we can only say MOVE(A,TABLE,B).  To
;;; add in a variable facility is a lot more coding, and I figured I'd
;;; save you the hassle of unification.  If you want to give it a shot,
;;; I have written up some unification code which might help you out.
;;; Another consequence of not having a variable facility is that you
;;; can't rely on the least-commitment heuristic of not immediately
;;; binding variables to constants.  For us, we must *immediately*
;;; commit to constants.  That makes our search space much nastier.
;;; C'est la vie!
