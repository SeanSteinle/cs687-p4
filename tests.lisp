Data Structures Notes:
- you can get specific struct members like: (plan-operators myplan). that's equivalent to myplan.operators

TODO:
- test an isolated case of hooking operators to ensure that we can mutate the plan safely/correctly
- better understand the recursive nature/high-level structure of how function calls are made. should enable solving the 2-world blocksworld, but no optimizations
